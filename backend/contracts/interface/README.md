# Web3 Sponsors 🫶🏽

Interfaces for interacting with the Ξlimu DAO's education sponsorship program (https://sponsors.elimu.ai)

If you want to integrate your own smart contracts with Ξlimu DAO's education sponsorship program, install this library:

```shell
npm install @elimu-ai/web3-sponsors
```

## Add Sponsorship 💜

If you want your smart contract to *add a new sponsorship* to our queue of sponsorships, start by importing its interface:

Then, instantiate the smart contract(s) you want to interact with:

```solidity
import { ISponsorshipQueue } from "@elimu-ai/web3-sponsors/ISponsorshipQueue.sol";

contract MyContract {
    ISponsorshipQueue public immutable sponsorshipQueue;

    constructor() {
        sponsorshipQueue = ISponsorshipQueue("0x47071D164900986994e4cc75DB1AF0ee0D04C6df");
    }

    function myFunction() {
        sponsorshipQueue.addSponsorship();
    }
}
```

Next, add logic to your smart contract for checking if it holds enough ETH to pay for one sponsorship:

```diff
import { ILanguages } from "@elimu-ai/web3-sponsors/ISponsorshipQueue.sol";

contract MyContract {
    ISponsorshipQueue public immutable sponsorshipQueue;

    constructor() {
        sponsorshipQueue = ISponsorshipQueue("0x47071D164900986994e4cc75DB1AF0ee0D04C6df");
    }

    function myFunction() {
+        require(address(this).balance > sponsorshipQueue.estimatedCost(), "Not enough ETH");
        sponsorshipQueue.addSponsorship();
    }
}
```

For a sample implementation, see [`CommunityFund.sol`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/web3-sponsors/tree/main/backend/contracts/sample/CommunityFund.sol).

> [!WARNING]
> The `estimatedCost` parameter set in the SponsorshipQueue smart contract can be adjusted by the Ξlimu DAO, so make sure to implement your code in a way that can handle this.
